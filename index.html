        <h2>Visiting the Taj Mahal: Everything you need to know</h2>
        <h4>written by bex shaprio||August 9</h4>

         <h4>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj Mahal?</h4>
         <p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one. <br>
            <br>
            At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand,
            no declaration of love more apparent than <br>
             building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing <br>
             its magnificence up close. <br>
             <br> 
            After all, this is art. Built in Agra,
            <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india">India</a> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, <br>
            it’s the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos.
            So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj <br>Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from <br>
             Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.<br>
             <br>
            Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), and so much more…</p>                 
    </div>
    <div class="sec-3">
        <h2>Before you arrive at Taj mahal</h2>
        <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal. <br>
            <br>
            Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian <br>
             men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you. <br>
             <br>          
            To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group. <br> 
            Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from 8-day Golden Triangle tours (now with solo-only <br>
             departures!) to 15-day trips dedicated to food, to 19-day trips combining the highlights of India and Nepal. <br>           
            If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from Delhi. <br>
            <br>
            Check out Urban Adventures to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while <br>
             you’re at it, check out their day trips in Delhi, Jaipur, Varanasi and Mumbai!</p>

          alt="pic 3"> 
          <p>The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally prepared, you’ll be fine. <br>
            What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p>       
        </div>
        <div class="sec-4">
            <h2>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have <br>
                 minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in. 
            <br>
            <br>
                You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:
            
            <div class="list">
                <ul>
                <li type="square">Passport</li>
                <br>
                <li type="square">Money</li>
                <br>
                <li type="square">Medicine</li>
                <br>
                <li type="square">Camera</li>
                <br>
                <li type="square">Phone</li>
            </ul></div>
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sec-5">
        <h2>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h2>
        <p>
            There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. <br>
            If you want to enter the mosque, you will need to cover your head, shoulders and knees. <br>
            <br>
            It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear sunscreen. <br>
            Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too. <br>
            <br>
            If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid <br>
             the worst of the heat. <br>
             <br>

              Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:
              <br>
              <br>
               Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are <br>
               easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are <br>
               to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of <br>
               laces are hard!

            <h2>When your at the taj mahal</h2>
            <p>
                Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds <br>
                (if possible). <br>
             <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg"
              alt="pic 6"> <br>
              If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an <br>
              amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to <br>
              take you there and back cheaply.) <br>
              <br>
              some tips on how to do this: <br>
              She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting <br>
              the Taj Mahal at sunrise on a clear day. <br>
              <br>
              And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly (<br>
              or more!) remain in awe of it. <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/sana-female-intrepid-leader-india/">Sana Jinah,</a> 
              one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has <br>
              some tips on how to do this:
              The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So, once I’m  <br>
              done briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try to <br>
               make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I say what they are then <br>
               they will no longer be surprises!

            <h1>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h1>
            <p>
                Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit <br>
                on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop. <br>
                <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg"
                 alt="pic 7"> <br>
                 But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth <br>
                 seeking out.
                 Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/pravin-intrepid-manager-gender-equality-india/">Pravin <br>Tamang</a> 
                 . (His photography is amazing – check it out!)

                    <li type="square">Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s <br>
                        main platform</li>
                    <li type="square">Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
                    <li type="square">Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
                    <li type="square">The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li>
                 </ul>
                 You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. <br>
                 Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the <br>
                  day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric! <br>

        <h2>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h2>
        <p>
            As you may have read or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough clean. <br>
            Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.
            <br>
            <br>
            Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white <br>
            surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work – <br>
            applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried <br>
            out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects <br>
            carried out on the historic site. <br>
